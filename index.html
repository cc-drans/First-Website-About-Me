        <p>I didn't know what else to make a website about and all of this website 
            building stuff is still very confusing to me, so I just wanted to make
            this website as simple as I could. What better thing to make a simple 
            website about than the thing I know the most about? <br> <strong>Me!</strong>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>I was born in Tacoma, WA on April 28, 1996. It was a Sunday, not that
      I remember that fact, but my mother does. I was 10lbs 13.8oz so I was a 
      very <em>chonky</em> baby. I have three older siblings. When I was three, my family
      moved to Linn, MO cause my dad's family was living there and he went into
      business with my grandpa building houses.</p><p> My childhood was great. 
    I went to elementary school and high school there. I was pretty
    introverted so I didn't really participate in a lot of things. I did work
    at McDonal's throughout High School. I tried my hand at a few different sports,
    but was never a big fan of them. I did marching band for half of high school,
    but dropped out so I could focus more on art classes. I <em>love</em> to paint!
    I was best friends with my grade's valedictorian which is the only reason
    I think I managed to graduatea in the top 10 of my class. (Ok, not the only
reason. I do think I'm smart.) Then again my graduating class was only about
60 people, so...</p>
<h2>College Life</h2>
    <p>As nice as Missouri was, I got out of there as soon as possible.
    I went to college at Southern Virginia University in a small town called
    Buena Vista, VA. I chose to go to this school because of the strong connection
    it has to my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I 
    majored in English with a minor in Creative Writing and I started the teaching
    liscensure process. </p><p> Two years into my college life, I took a two year break
    to serve a mission for my church in Boise, ID. I served for 18 months and it
    was one of the best things I ever chose to do. I learned so much not only 
    about the gospel of Jesus Christ, but about myself as well. </p><p> After my mission,
    I came back to SVU where I finished up two more years. After I was done with
    my classes, I started student teaching. Turned out to be the worst thing
    I've ever done. I realized teaching was not for me and dropped out of the 
    program. Soon after, I got a job at a library and fell in love with the 
    environment and the work and realized that my next step was to pursue an 
    MLS degree.</p>
<h2>Married Life</h2>
    <p>Shortly after the onset of COVID, I met my now husband through a mutual
        friend. His name is Caleb. We started as friends, but it became really
        obvious early on that we both like each other and it didn't take long for 
        us to start dating. We dated for quite a few months before he proposed and
        then we were married on July 24, 2021. 
    </p><p>Shortly after getting married, we moved to Binghamton, NY where he 
        is currently getting his MA in Theatre with the goal to go on to get his 
        PhD and become a college professor. We just recently celebrated our one 
        year anniversary and a couple days before that found out we were pregnant 
        with our first baby. We're super excited and I'm currently 12 weeks along
        right now. We did already start our family back in January by adopting a 
        cat. Her name is Serafina. She's an orange cat with six toes on each of 
        her paws.
    </p>
    <h2>Some of my Favorite Things</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite things to do are hang out with my husband and cat, 
            watch TV/movies, play board games, paint, make resin DnD dice, go on hikes, 
            and of course read. Listed below are some of my more recent favorite books
            that I've read just in case anyone needs any good recommendations. They're 
            in no particular order.
        <ul>
            <li><em>Crown of Feathers</em> by Nicki Pau Preto</li>
            <li><em>Aurora Rising</em> by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff</li>
            <li><em>Bone Crier's Moon</em> by Kathryn Purdie</li>
            <li><em>Circe</em> by Madeline Miller</li>
            <li><em>Renegades</em> by Marissa Meyer</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Well, I think that's pretty much all you need to know about me! 
            I am an open book though, so if you've got any questions, I will 
            probably tell you more than you actually want to know. You have been 
            warned.
