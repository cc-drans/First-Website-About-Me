        <p>I didn't know what else to make a website about and all of this website 
            building stuff is still very confusing to me, so I just wanted to make
            this website as simple as I could. What better thing to make a simple 
            website about than the thing I know the most about? <strong>Me!</strong>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <body>I was born in Tacoma, WA on April 28, 1996. It was a Sunday, not that
      I remember that fact, but my mother does. I was 10lbs 13.8oz so I was a 
      very big baby. I have three older siblings. When I was three, my family
      moved to Linn, MO cause my dad's family was living there and he went into
      business with my grandpa building houses.</body>
