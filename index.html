        <p>I didn't know what else to make a website about and all of this website 
            building stuff is still very confusing to me, so I just wanted to make
            this website as simple as I could. What better thing to make a simple 
            website about than the thing I know the most about? <strong>Me!</strong>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <body>I was born in Tacoma, WA on April 28, 1996. It was a Sunday, not that
      I remember that fact, but my mother does. I was 10lbs 13.8oz so I was a 
      very <em>chonky</em> baby. I have three older siblings. When I was three, my family
      moved to Linn, MO cause my dad's family was living there and he went into
      business with my grandpa building houses.<br> My childhood was great. 
    I went to elementary school and high school there. I was pretty
    introverted so I didn't really participate in a lot of things. I did work
    at McDonal's throughout High School. I tried my hand at a few different sports,
    but was never a big fan of them. I did marching band for half of high school,
    but dropped out so I could focus more on art classes. I <em>love</em> to paint!
    I was best friends with my grade's valedictorian which is the only reason
    I think I managed to graduatea in the top 10 of my class. (Ok, not the only
reason. I do think I'm smart.) Then again my graduating class was only about
60 people, so...</body>
